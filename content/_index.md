## whoami
Hello! Online I usually go by Mauzy or Mauzy0x00. I am a Cyber Security student and information technology enthusiast. 

I spend most of my time learning something new in this field and I love that there is no end to what you can learn. I love to help others learn something new or accomplish a task so don't hesitate to ask me for help! 

## what is this webpage?
Here I will be writing posts about things I create, setup or hack! These are written mostly for myself and documenation but I hope that they can help someone like you too! These write-ups are written as I complete tasks and I document issues that I ran into
along the way. They will not be perfect so if you decide to follow along and see an issue or misconfiguration please let me know! 

Along with technology write-ups I will also include other things like recipies or fixes on my car that are either unconventional or wasn't well documented :)
